# Analyzing-E-commerce-Transactions-Project
In this project, I analyzed a customer transaction dataset to uncover insights into customer retention, transaction behavior, and product performance. The goal was to identify trends in customer cohorts, product profitability, and revenue distribution to inform business decisions and marketing strategies

Solution Overview:
To address the problem, I developed a Customer Cohort Analysis system that tracks customer transactions over time, segments customers into cohorts based on their first purchase month, and analyzes their behavior, such as repeat purchases and revenue contribution. The analysis also extended to examining the profitability of products and the overall sales performance by product line and brand.


By analyzing customer cohorts, we could gain a deeper understanding of customer retention rates and purchasing behaviors, and use these insights to improve customer lifetime value (CLV) and marketing efforts.
